In _Determining Solar Cell Parameters and Degradation Rates from Power Production Data_ (Chakar et al., 2022), we demonstrated the exciting possibility of extracting the diode-model parameters and degradation rates of a photovoltaic system from widely-accessible power generation and weather data.

In _A Bayesian Inference Approach to Extract Circuit Model Parameters and Analyze Photovoltaic Degradation from Power Production Data_ (Chakar et al., 2023), we show how switching to the Bayesian framework can help us construct probability distributions over the model parameters, get a comprehensive picture of the solution space, and quantify prediction uncertainty in an effort to overcome the challenges associated with this task.
